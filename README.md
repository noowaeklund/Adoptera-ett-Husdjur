## Main Concepts Used in This Project
1. Flask: A micro web framework written in Python. It's used to develop web applications.
2. Routes and View Functions: The `@app.route` decorator is used to bind a function to a URL route. When the route is visited, the associated function is executed.
3. Dynamic Routes: The `<pet_type>` in `@app.route('/animals/<pet_type>')` is a variable part of the URL. Flask captures the value and passes it as an argument to the function.
4. HTML in Python: HTML code is returned from the view functions as multi-line strings. This HTML is then rendered in the user's browser.
5. Importing Modules: The `helper` module is imported and used in the `animals` function.
6. List Comprehensions: A list comprehension is used to generate a list of HTML list items.
7. String Formatting: The `f-string` syntax is used to insert variables into strings.
